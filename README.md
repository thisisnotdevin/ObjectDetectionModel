## notes prior building

working with important library `Object detection model` coco-ssd located in tensorflow.js. For our project we will be using the pre-trained
ssd model that we will leverage from the link below.
More information visit this [tensorflow/tfjs-models](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models#readme)

## notes for future refference 

working with tenseflow.js and react.js, eliminating "fingerpose" from package.json as it is from a previous code set.

to install everything we open the command, cd to out folder destination, and type `npm install` this will install all our packages

- node_modules created.

after, we will update our App.js file and check out the TODO which will update us if we want to use real time object detection react app for other usage.

1. TODO - Import required model here:
  which is coming from our cocossd package, code below
  > import * as cocossd from "@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd";
  after this step, our first dependency is imported.
  this step basically allows us to download our pre-trained tensorflow.js model
